The goal of this project is to analyze three different datasets from a building.

Check the `Presentation.pdf` for the graphs !

The main code is in `alcala.py`.

## 📝 Some explanations

The **Alcalá Building** is a fictitious office building located in Madrid, Spain.

Two types of **sensor technologies** are installed in this building: Wi-Fi sensors and smart meters. A Wi-Fi analytics model was used to **count the number of times people entered the building** over a given day.

**Two smart meters** independently measure the **electrical energy consumption** of both the elevator and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.
